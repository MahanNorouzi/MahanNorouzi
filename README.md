# 👋 Hey, I'm Mahan

💻 **Front-End Developer**  
I craft responsive, high-performance interfaces that look sharp and feel smooth.

## 🛠️ What I’m Into
- Building clean, modern UIs
- Writing scalable, maintainable code
- Exploring new front-end tech and design trends

## 🏎️ Outside the Code
When I’m not coding, you’ll catch me:
- 🏋️‍♂️ Crushing it at the gym
- 🚗 Geeking out over cars
